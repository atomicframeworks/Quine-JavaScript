# Quine-JavaScript
### A quine written in JS.

> A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. The standard terms for these programs in the computability theory and computer science literature are "self-replicating programs", "self-reproducing programs", and "self-copying programs".

This is not the most clever implementations of a quine, but is instead designed to be as clear as possible.
